          doing ruthless things like kissing his girlfriend (without consent)
          and killing his dog.

          Kira is the main villain of JJBA Part 4. He is a serial killer in the
          small town of Morioh. One of his famous lines is: "My name is
          Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section
          of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as
          an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every
          day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink.
          I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no
          matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty
          minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems
          sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any
          fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at
          my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes
          to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any
          enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at
          night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings
          me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone."
          His stand is Killer Queen and has abilities called Sheer Heart Attack
          and Bites the Dust. The stand is named after Queen's songs.
